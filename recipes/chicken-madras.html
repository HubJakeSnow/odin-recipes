    <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
    <p>A madras curry is a hot curry with a dark red thick sauce (the colour comes from the chillies and tomatoes). 
        It's got slightly tangy notes to it from the addition of tamarind and fenugreek.
         The chicken <strong>does not have</strong> to be marinated in this dish, however we will be. The sauce is usually a smooth sauce.
        We're using a madras curry paste in this recipe, but will also add in a few extra spices. 
        To get the lovely smooth sauce, we'll be using passata 
        (rather than tinned tomatoes - which are quite lumpy).
        <strong>Best served with naan and/or rice. <em>Four portions.</em></strong></p>
