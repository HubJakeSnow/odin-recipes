        <li><strong>Skip this step if you have already peeled your potatoes.</strong> 
        Peel your potatoes, keep the skins to one side and put the rest of the potato
        away as we don't need that for this recipe. (If you're stuck with what to make with

        salt, pepper, cajun seasoning, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano & 
        tumeric.</li>
        <li>Mix the potato skins with the oil and seasonings, until they're all evenly spread.</li>
        <li>Add some flour to the bowl if you want your potato skins to be 
        <em>extra crunchy!</em></li>
        <li>Put in an air-fryer or oven at 200 degrees celcius for 18-25 minutes- 
        depending on how think your peels are and how crispy you want them.</li>
        <li>Shake the peels every 6-8 minutes until golden brown.</li>
