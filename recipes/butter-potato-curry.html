    <p><h3>Steps:</h3></p>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Peel your potatoes <strong>(Don't throw them away!</strong> Make some 
        <em>amazing</em>
        <a href="../recipes/crispy-potato-skins.html">crispy potato skins</a> instead).</li>
        <li>Boil your potatoes with salt and strain them <em>just before</em> they are completely finsihed.
        While waiting for your potatoes to boil, chop your onions and garlic into small cubes.
        Leave the potatoes to dry in the pot with the lid <strong>on.</strong></li>
        <li>Heat up a new pan with oil and add butter. When the butter has melted, add 
        your chopped onions.</li>
        <li>When your onions have changed colour and your chopped garlic and ginger paste.</li>
        <li>Add your choice of seasonings. Here's the ones we used: Salt, pepper, paprika,
        cinnimon, oregano, garam masala, garlic powder, onion powder & tumeric.</li>
        <li>Stir and let cook for 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato puree, 150ml of water and cashew nuts (Save some cashews until
        the end of you want to add a crunch to your curry).</li>
        <li>Add your spinach, then cook for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the passata, stir and wait 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Blend the mixture then add back to the pan with more butter, cream and 
        your <em>nearly cooked </em>potatoes. Leave to simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Garnish with cream and corrinader. Add any leftover cashews if you want a crunch. </li>
        <li>Enjoy your delicious veggie curry!</li>
