# odin-recipes
This project is to build a recipe website that leads to three different
 webpages; the recipes must include an image, a description, an ingredient
list & steps to make the dish. The skills I have demonstrated in this 
project include: Building a webpage, adding images, using <strong> and 
<em>, building lists, adding/committing/pushing with git in the terminal.
