# odin-recipes
This project is to build a recipe website that leads to three differentwebpages; the recipes must include an image, a description, an ingredient list & steps to make the dish. The skills I have demonstrated in this  project include: Building a webpage, adding images, using the "strong" and "em" tags, building lists, adding/committing/pushing with git in the terminal.
